This project is a time series analysis model to predict the annual rainfall in various regions of India. We have used 2 models here:

1. Deep Learning based model using CNNs and RNNs.
2. Moving and exponential average model.

The rainfall data has been obtained from the offiical website of the Indian Meterological Department.
